  (defmacro nasy/protect-macros (&rest body)
    "Eval BODY, protecting macros from incorrect expansion.
  This macro should be used in the following situation:
  Some form is being evaluated, and this form contains as a
  sub-form some code that will not be evaluated immediately, but
  will be evaluated later. The code uses a macro that is not
  defined at the time the top-level form is evaluated, but will be
  defined by time the sub-form's code is evaluated. This macro
  handles its arguments in some way other than evaluating them
  directly. And finally, one of the arguments of this macro could
  be interpreted itself as a macro invocation, and expanding the
  invocation would break the evaluation of the outer macro.
  You might think this situation is such an edge case that it would
  never happen, but you'd be wrong, unfortunately. In such a
  situation, you must wrap at least the outer macro in this form,
  but can wrap at any higher level up to the top-level form."

  (defmacro after! (package &rest body)
    "Evaluate BODY after PACKAGE have loaded.
  PACKAGE is a symbol or list of them. These are package names, not modes,
  functions or variables. It can be:
  - An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)
      (after! helm BODY...)
  - An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
    and git-gutter have loaded)
      (after! (magit git-gutter) BODY...)
  - An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of
    :or/:any and :and/:all
      (after! (:or package-a package-b ...)  BODY...)
      (after! (:and package-a package-b ...) BODY...)
      (after! (:and package-a (:or package-b package-c) ...) BODY...)
    Without :or/:any/:and/:all, :and/:all are implied.
  This is a wrapper around `eval-after-load' that:
  1. Suppresses warnings for disabled packages at compile-time
  2. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!')
  3. Supports compound package statements (see below)
  4. Prevents eager expansion pulling in autoloaded macros all at once"
