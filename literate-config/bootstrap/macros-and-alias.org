  (defmacro after! (package &rest body)
    "Evaluate BODY after PACKAGE have loaded.
  PACKAGE is a symbol or list of them. These are package names, not modes,
  functions or variables. It can be:
  - An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)
      (after! helm BODY...)
  - An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
    and git-gutter have loaded)
      (after! (magit git-gutter) BODY...)
  - An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of
    :or/:any and :and/:all
      (after! (:or package-a package-b ...)  BODY...)
      (after! (:and package-a package-b ...) BODY...)
      (after! (:and package-a (:or package-b package-c) ...) BODY...)
    Without :or/:any/:and/:all, :and/:all are implied.
  This is a wrapper around `eval-after-load' that:
  1. Suppresses warnings for disabled packages at compile-time
  2. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!')
  3. Supports compound package statements (see below)
  4. Prevents eager expansion pulling in autoloaded macros all at once"
