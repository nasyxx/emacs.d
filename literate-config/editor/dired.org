* Dired

DiredMode is the mode of a Dired buffer.  It shows a directory (folder) listing
that you can use to perform various operations on files and subdirectories in
the directory. The operations you can perform are numerous, from creating
subdirectories to byte-compiling files, searching files, and of course visiting
(editing) files.
